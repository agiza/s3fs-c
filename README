S3FS-C

S3FS-C is FUSE (File System in User Space) based solution to mount/unmount an Amazon S3 storage buckets and use system commands with S3 just like it was another Hard Disk. It is forked from s3fs release 1.59 and rewritten to be compatible with other tools (s3cmd, AWS Management Console, etc). it supports explicit folder objects (i.e. key names end with /) and implicit folders. However it is no longer compatible with the original s3fs.

For installation and other instructions, see http://code.google.com/p/s3fs/wiki/FuseOverAmazon

Known Issues:
-------------
s3fs should be working fine with S3 storage. However, There are couple of limitations:

* There is no full UID/GID support yet, everything looks as "root" and if you allow others to access the bucket, others can erase files. There is, however, permissions support built in.
* Moving/renaming implicit folders is not currently supported. It will be added at a later time.
